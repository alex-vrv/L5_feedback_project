# L5 --> L2/3 feedback project
Simulating modulation of L2/3 population responses to L4 input, by different configurations of L5 subpopulations - network of integrate-and-fire neurons

### organization
- code: structured notebooks for simulations
- helpers: stimulus builders
- batch_scripts: py files for running batch simulations
